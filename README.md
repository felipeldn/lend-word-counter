# Lendable Application

The React app within this directory contains the solution to the problem described below:

**Please return an integer detailing the amount of words in a sentence, not including numbers and special characters:**

Example 1 = 'How many eggs are in a half-dozen, 13?', should yield a result of 7, hyphened words count as one.

Example 2 = 'b? Dl )B 4(V! A. MK, YtG ](f 1m )CNxuNUR {PG?' should yield a result of 5.

**Newly deployed version with small changes. Please note that the old link is still active and can still be used.**

New version deployed at 15:45, Thursday 4th November, 2021. 

Deployed in order to make small frontend changes, such as different messages inside the `Result` component output depending on the number of valid words, i.e. "Your string contained one valid word" or "Your string contained 5 valid words"

One more small change, the title and logo in the browser tab have been changed to match this repo being a Lendable code challenge:
